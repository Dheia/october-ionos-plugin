A really simple plugin, which allows you to easily update your OctoberCMS websites on php-restricted 
webhosting providers, such as IONOS, using the new command `ionos:update`.


What's the difference to october:update?
----------------------------------------

The `october:update` command pass `php ...` to the `passthru` PHP function, which is completely 
cool on almost all environments and hosting provider in the world wide web. However, some providers, 
which offers an SSH access to their packages, support multiple PHP versions side-by-side and may 
use a deprecated version for the standard `php` command. For example: IONOS uses version 4.4.9 on 
the default `php` command, which can easily be changed when using SSH, but not when PHP itself calls 
these using one of the available PHP functions.

The new added `ionos:update` uses `php7.4-cli` instead of `php`, but allows you to change this 
default by adding the option `--phpv=[PHP_ENV]`. When, for whatever reason, your PHP environment 
command does not start with `php`, you can skip this check with `--skip-nophp` as well.
